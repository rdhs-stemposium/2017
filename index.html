                    <p>The Science Research Class offered at River Dell High School allows students to conduct original science research and compete in science competitions. Starting in their sophomore year, students explore various subject areas in the sciences that interest them, first by reading and evaluating general literature, then progressing to journals in scientific literature. Areas of study that may be investigated include mathematics, technology, physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences, psychology, and more.</p>
                    <p>Science Research improves student's written and oral communication skills. During their research, students take notes and write responses to articles in their own lab notebooks. Students’ work is frequently reviewed to ensure progress on their projects. Students are also required to give presentations on their findings about twice a month. Other students give constructive criticism regarding improvements on their research as well as presentation skills.</p>
