                  The Science Research Class offered at River Dell High School allows students to conduct original research and compete in various science competitions. Starting in their sophomore year, students explore various subject areas in the sciences that interest them, first by reading and evaluating general literature, then progressing to journals in scientific literature. Areas of study that may be investigated include mathematics, technology, physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences, psychology, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Science Research improves student's written and oral communication skills. During their research, students take notes and write responses to articles in their own lab notebooks. Students’ work is frequently reviewed to ensure progress on their projects. Students are also required to give presentations on their findings about twice a month. Other students give constructive criticism regarding improvements on their research as well as presentation skills.

                      Headlines about cyber-attacks have become increasingly more common over the past decade. Although the investigation of vulnerabilities on hardware and operating systems is plentiful, few research projects have been conducted on the human-element of device security. Mobile devices come with a myriad of security options that the user can choose to enable, but whether users choose to enable those security features or not has never been surveyed before.  For instance, iOS users have the option to enable “iCloud Activation Lock.”  By doing so, an individual’s device is much more greatly secured, alas, it is up to the user to decide whether to enable the security measure.  It is also possible that the user does not know that the security measure exists, in which case, our survey determines that level of awareness.  Our proposal is to administer a survey to River Dell High School students that consists of questions concerning the security measures that they have in place on their personal device.  We hope that our project will yield a greater understanding of teen’s awareness of cyber security and the measures that they take to secure their devices.

                      Over the last two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as the leading noninvasive method of examining the brain regions involved in complex neurological processes.  Several studies have examined sex differences in functional and behavioral responses to verbal and visual stimuli, but few have studied differences in response to musical stimuli. This study investigates sex differences in functional responses to emotional musical stimuli in both depressed and non-depressed participants. Data was obtained from a dataset published by Rebecca J. Lepping et. al on OpenfMRI, an open-access fMRI database. 19 participants (8 male, 11 female) diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 20 never-depressed (ND) participants (9 male, 11 female) were subjected to 3 different stimuli: emotionally neutral "pure tones", positive and negative musical stimuli. Each participant underwent five sessions each consisting of a 31.5-second musical sample followed by 31.5 seconds of pure tones, separated by a three-second response period, repeated four times per session.  Data was analyzed using SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping).  Results indicate greater activation in healthy males in the primary auditory area (superior frontal gyrus) in response to both positive and negative music, while healthy females displayed greater activation of the thalamus and amygdala in response to negative music. Results also indicate greater activation in depressed males in the prefrontal cortex in response to positive music as well as greater activation in depressed males in the left pallidum in response to negative music.

                      Fluorescent sensors are traditionally used as indicators, both in fluorescent microscopes and other mediums. Fluoresent sensors react to changes in pH and configurations within the molecule to either fluoresce or not fluoresce. Most fluorescent sensors are non-polar, and therefore insoluble in water. In order to be dissolved in solution, a non-polar solvent such as methanol must be used. In order to create soluble fluorescent indicators, fluorescent compounds can be transformed into ionic liquids, which can be dissolved in water. As a part of a larger study, a fluorescent compound with a pyridine receptor was reacted with methyl iodide to form an ionic liquid. The original compound  was fluorescent at high pH and non-fluorescent at low pH. When transformed into an ionic liquid, the compound exhibited no fluorescence at any pH due to the formation of a pyridinium ring as the disabled sensor compound. The attachment of the methyl group to the nitrogen neutralized the fluorescence, acting similar to the way a hydronium ion does when the original compound was placed in an acidic environment. The results of this study suggest that fluorescent compounds containing a pyridine receptor ring are not viable as fluorescent ionic sensors, as through the process of transforming the fluorescent compound to an ionic liquid, the fluorescence is neutralized. In order to create suitable ionic liquids, other organic cations should be examined and studied further.

                      TIMP-2 (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) is a gene expressed in both human and mice that encodes proteins responsible for the inhibition of metalloproteinases, a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix for cell migration and invasion. In addition, this gene has another unique role among the TIMP family in its ability to directly suppress the proliferation of endothelial cells. On the other hand, TIMP-2 is an ideal candidate for assessing the roles of 3’ UTR (untranslated region) in gene expression and protein function, due to the nature of its long 3’ UTR and 2 distinctive polyA sites located in the 3’ UTR. The 3’ UTR length is sensitive to alternative cleavage and polyadenylation regulation. CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be applied and Timp2 3’ UTR regions can be alternatively deleted. Phenotype validation can then be determined by testing for variation in cell migration, invasion, and proliferation rates between different knockout cell lines.

                      Additive biomanufacturing is the process of printing 3D living constructs where stem cells interface with biomaterials. In a far-field melt electrospin writing process, a polymer material is drawn from a needle to a collector plate, and the processed polymer from the needle tip constitutes the charged fiber. The temperature differential between the needle tip and the plate is defined as temperature gradient; and it affects fiber deformation (that determines fiber diameter) and electrostatic repulsion between fibers (that, through relative alignment of multiple fibers, determines pore size in a 3D polymer construct). A construct with microscale fiber diameters and pore sizes can facilitate confinement of stem cells to prevent stem cells from differentiation. The first research objective is to understand effects of temperature gradient on fiber deformation and electrostatic repulsion between fibers. A multi-physics model (coupling polymer rheology and electrostatics) will be developed to predict effects of temperature gradient on fiber deformation and electrostatic repulsion. The second objective is to establish relationships between fiber deformation and fiber diameter, and between electrostatic repulsion and pore size. Scanning electron microscopy will be used to measure mean fiber diameter and pore size in an electrospun construct. The third objective is to understand effects of fiber diameter and pore size on 3D stem cell confinement. A geometrical-based model will be developed to predict effects of confined 3D focal adhesion site distribution (point contacts between electrospun fibers and colonized cells) on stem cell function. Experiments will be conducted to colonize stem cells on the electrospun constructs, and the focal adhesion distribution will be measured using atomic force microscopy and fluorescent confocal microscopy. Immunochemistry of stem cell surface markers will be conducted to confirm stem cell confinement.

                      In order to test the correlation between strength and flexibility, a study was conducted that records the core strength and hip flexibility of a number of dancers. These dancers were between the ages of 12 and 18. The study was tested on advanced female competitive dancers who train in ballet, jazz, contemporary, etc. A 60 degree ramp was used to test the core strength. Dancers would lean on the ramp and then it was taken away and the time that the dancers could hold the 60 degree shape was recorded. The duration of time the dancers could hold a plank was also recorded for figuring out their core strength. To test flexibility, the degree measure of the center split was recorded. The hypothesis for this experiment is that the more flexible a dancer is, the less core strength they have. This study is still being analyzed and will be retested in the future.

                      A recent study conducted by the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has indicated a possible cumulative weight gain on the body mass index of children. In February of 2012, colleagues of the Hopkin’s Bloomberg School of Public Health analyzed electronic health records of approximately 163,000 children from ages 3-18 who have a suggested health history of significant antibiotics intake. Records have been critically categorized in order to provide the most accurate experimental control (specifics are included in the presentation). The truth behind the case study of whether or not significant intake of antibiotics during childhood has a cumulative effect of body mass index, is analytically discussed and further explored in the presentation.

                      Opioid abuse is a very big problem everywhere in the world. It also doesn’t help that a lot of people that are in jail for anything similar are most likely addicted to opiates. Treating these addictions is a hard thing to do, due to the fact there are many connections between neurons associated with the addiction. On top of that, treatment is barely done for the criminal justice populations inside a US jail. This study aims to show the results of an experiment in which two groups of prisoners (all one month from release) are treated initially at jail and then one group continues to be treated from their place of residence, while the other group is treated at a community treatment program. This was done to show, if the environment of one’s treatment has an effect on how effective it will be.

                      Learning With the Kinect (LWK) is a project aimed at uncovering what learning style can benefit the most from a lesson structured around the Microsoft® Kinect. When approved, the experiment will take place at River Dell Middle School. Each student will use the LWK software to try to achieve the highest score possible. The LWK software has options for both English (Grammar) testing as well as Logic (Algebra) testing. Students will use their hands in kinesthetic motions, picked up by the Kinect sensor, to drag and drop answers on the screen. After the experiment has concluded, the data will be analyzed to see which type of learning style benefitted from the LWK program the most.

                      An odorant molecule, which can only be a volatile chemical compound, is detected and carried to the olfactory region/epithelium, which is located between the nose and the eyes. In order for an odorant to exist, it must have certain solubility properties, low polarity, enough vapor pressure, and surface activity. The mucus in the nasal passageway help transport odorant molecules to the olfactory receptors. The small region contains about 50 million sensory receptor cells, or olfactory sensory neurons. The neurons are made of 8-10 cilia each, which are tiny hairs that contain proteins, such as G-protein receptors, that attach to specific odor molecules, initiating the electrical response to the brain. The olfactory sensory neurons are the only neurons in the mammalian nervous system that not only regenerate naturally and in response to injury, but also project to specific targets in the brain. A biosensor would mimic the olfactory system by having receptors react to specific odorant molecules by sending an electric signal to a computer. Some disorders associated with olfactory sensory neurons and olfactory dysfunction include neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, in which smell loss often occurs before other symptoms of those diseases. Smell loss also has been associated with schizophrenia, which is considered neurodevelopmental. Biosensors may be able to help people regain their sense of smell.

                      Electric Network Frequency (ENF) is a tried and tested, reliable tool for timestamp verification and forgery detection in possibly tampered multimedia recordings such as videos and audios. An ENF signal is imbedded to an audio file due to the electromagnetic interference from the powerlines, and alternatively an ENF signal is analyzed by the frequency fluctuations in indoor lighting. Therefore, ENF timestamp verification does not work on a video file that is recorded outdoors without any manufactured lighting. A multimedia file can be verified by cross-referencing the extracted ENF signal from the file to the reference ENF collected from a power grid located around the location where the multimedia file was claimed to be recorded. Location is important as the ENF from the multimedia file must correlate to the ENF collected from the power grid. Otherwise the file cannot be validated as authentic because if the behavior of the ENF signals do not match, it becomes evident that the file has been modified, or tampered with. In this paper the analysis of ENF timestamp verification in videos is being validated by comparing the ENF signal of visual recordings with an ENF signal from a corresponding power grid.

                      Most satellites are built using two different approaches: either large, complex systems or small, simplified designs. A common problem in satellites, particularly solar sail-based vessels, is that of the efficiency of the satellite. How effective a solar sail based satellite is can be calculated by dividing the overall area of the sail to the total mass of the satellite, in what is called the Area-to-Mass ratio. The criteria for a satellite to defined as High Area to Mass Ratio Spacecraft (HAMRS) requires the Area-to-Mass ratio to be greater than 1m^2/kg. The focus of our research is to develop sails with a high A/M ratio, as well as a more effective way of steering within the sail itself.

The objective of my research was to find the fuel that had the highest horsepower output and efficiency for a Honda CBR600RR engine. In this research study I gather information from  the Formula SAE Michigan results and literature review to choose a fuel that not only offers the best performance, but also offers consistency and ease of use.

                      Hydrogen Peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) could be put in fuel calls as an oxidant source in a microreactor. Due to the high percent of Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) in hydrogen peroxide, as well as being a dense source of oxygen per unit volume (0.0215 moles/mL O<sub>2</sub>), it is possible for hydrogen peroxide to be a good source of oxygen in a fuel cell. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposes slowly naturally (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ➔ H<sub>2</sub>O + ½ O<sub>2</sub>), but the decomposition reaction can be accelerated greatly with a catalyst.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, the catalytic decomposition reaction is highly exothermic, and typically leads to thermal runaway, which limits its widespread implementation as an oxidant. A way to counter the large amounts of heat released is to perform the reaction in a microchemistry system, which have large surface-to-volume ratios which increases heat transfer through convective cooling and prevents thermal runaway. Thus, the use of microchemical systems for the decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> will allow for it to be used as an oxidant in a fuel cell without thermal runaway.

Astronomers can use several different methods to detect these extra-solar planetary systems. Direct imaging, measuring the changes in luminosity as a planet passes over its parent star, radio and infrared waves are some of the few ways astronomers can detect such extra-solar planets. By observing and discovering exoplanets, we can begin to understand how commonly planetary systems form and continue our quest in the search for life, and learn more about our place in the universe and answer the age old question of whether or not we are truly alone.

                      Hydrogels have become popular due to their favorable properties such as biocompatibility, flexibility, and high water content. Hydrogels are defined as water-soluble polymers that are capable of holding large amounts of water due to their hydrophilic functional groups. They were the first biomaterial to have been developed for human use and their ability to closely resemble living tissue opens up many application in biomedical areas. Hydrogels have many different uses, such as drug delivery and contact lenses. There are currently several methods that can be used to create these hydrogels like polymerization and parallel-cross linking. As of now, challenges still exist in their creation and their various applications as more research has to be done.

                      Since its discovery, the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has led to remarkable discoveries in the field of neuroscience. It is an advanced and powerful way to measure brain activity, in ways not previously possible. Prior to the discovery of the fMRI, scientists studied the brain by removing and dissecting post mortem human brains of patients to compare to healthy brains. Scientists also use EEG (Electroencephalogram) to measure brain electrical activity through electrodes placed on the scalp. However, using the EEG, it is difficult to track where in the brain the signal is coming from.  Other techniques used to probe brain functions such as computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans use radiation. fMRI provides a better groundbreaking alternative.

                    <p>
                      fMRI is a non-invasive and effective technique that can evaluate brain activity safely, without the use of radiation. It also produces high resolution images that are as detailed as 1 millimeter. The fMRI detects the location of brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. This technique relies on the correlation between blood flow and neural activity; when a specific area of the brain is active during a task, blood flow to that region increases. This makes the fMRI a useful tool in answering questions about experimentally related activations. The high-quality anatomical images of the brain and visualization of activated regions allow for a wide scope of research and studies.

                      Researchers study if perception can be manipulated by internal goals. Researchers hypothesize that desiring an object are seen as closer compared to less desirable ones. Researchers will test their hypothesis through five experiments.  (Thirst, obtainable money, humor, beanbag toss, comparison between two items) Researchers suggest desirable objects are seen as closer than less desirable objects assisting the self-regulatory function energizing the perceiver to fulfill personal goals and needs.

                      Although commercially used sunscreens and moisturizers address immediate skin protection, certain chemical compounds in these products bring harmful effects under long-term use. Inorganic and organic UV filters in sunscreen may trigger skin rashes, inflict cell damage, and disrupt hormones. The flawed chemical agents in moisturizers may also trigger skin irritation. As safer and more natural options were researched, cyanobacteria became a potential solution to replace these harmful ingredients. By producing mycosporine-like amino acids and the chemical compound scytonemin, cyanobacteria significantly deter UV radiation and retain moisture without detrimental effects. In fact, cyanobacteria produce other health benefits in having antioxidants and anti-viral properties. Further research is done in cultivating cyanobacteria for wide- production.

                       Antibiotic resistance is caused by misuse of antibiotics. Overuse of any antibiotic can result in harmful bacteria forming in the body. This bacteria makes the drug less or totally ineffective. They decrease the purpose of the drug and this bad bacteria is also more damaging to our bodies. Side effects of a certain antibiotic may be increased while its effects that are meant to be helpful deteriorate. In order to find a healthy way to prevent antibiotic resistance, doctors need to prescribe smaller amounts. Inappropriate prescription causes harmful bacteria to form, over time, making the antibiotic less useful.
